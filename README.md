# LangGraph Applications with Redis

This repository contains examples of how to implement memory management in LangGraph applications using Redis as database. It shows how to implement short-term memory (thread-scoped memory) and long-term memory (cross-threads memory) scenarios.

## Getting started

Before running any of the code available in the Jupyter notebooks, you will need a Redis database. For the sake of convenience, this repository provides a Docker Compose file that spin ups a Redis database for you. Just execute the following command to start it up: 

```bash
docker compose up
```

Now you can start following the instructions from the Jupyter notebooks. Have fun!
